# SQL-for-DataScience
# Description:
This repository contains assignments,quzzes and notes I completed in the course [SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science),
part of [Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science) from University of California,Davis offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
## About This Course:
This course is designed to give you a primer in the fundamentals of SQL and working with data so that you can begin analyzing it for data science purposes. You will begin to ask the right questions and come up with good answers to deliver valuable insights for your organization. This course starts with the basics and assumes you do not have any knowledge or skills in SQL. It will build on that foundation and gradually have you write both simple and complex queries to help you select data from tables.  You'll start to work with different types of data like strings and numbers and discuss methods to filter and pare down your results. 

You will create new tables and be able to move data into them. You will learn common operators and how to combine the data. You will use case statements and concepts like data governance and profiling. You will discuss topics on data, and practice using real-world programming assignments. You will interpret the structure, meaning, and relationships in source data and use SQL as a professional to shape your data for targeted analysis purposes.
# Requirements:
- Microsoft Word for some notes.
- A PDF reader for assignments and quizzes as they are in pdf format
- Any SQLite Compiler or Query runner.
  - SQLiteStudio is recommended as an offline compiler.
  - You can also use an online compiler like [sqliteonline](https://sqliteonline.com/).
- Any Text editor to save query and read notes in thos repository.
  - I recommend Notepad++.
  - Notepad++ has option to use specific SQL language syntax which highlights and changes colour of SQL commands which makes it easier to understand the query.
- Databases.
  - I used 2 databases for the most parts of this course.
    - Open Source [chinook](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/blob/main/DataBases/chinook.db) database:
      - database schema diagram for this database is provided within the [DataBases](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/DataBases) directory.
    - [test1](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/blob/main/DataBases/test1.db) database:
      - I made this short database myself for practise purpose and ended up using this database in few of the notes.

# Repository go through:
- Main directory of this repository has 4 Sub directories which are as follows.
  1. [**Assigments**](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/Assignments):
      - This directory contains the solved assignments for this course.
      - Most of these assignments are in pdf format
      - Final course assignment is in txt format.
      - There is a chinook database schema in this directory too which is slightly different from the chinook database provided in the [DataBases](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/DataBases) directory.
      - The assignments were solved on coursera platform and this schema is from the chinook database provided on that platform so follow this schema in case of assignments and quizzes. 
  2. [**DataBases**](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/DataBases):
      - This directory contains databases and their schemas used in this repository.
      - Schemas are in pdf format.
      - No Schema is provided for test1 database but it is very simple database so you would not have a problem.
  3. [**Notes**](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/Notes):
      - This directory contains notes i made during learning SQL.
      - These notes are based on SQL for DataScience Course.
      - Most of these notes are in sql format which can be readable through q text reader.
      - Some of the notes are in docx format which can be readable through microsoft word.
  4. [**Quizzes**](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/Quizzes):
      - This directory contains solved quizzes in this course.
      - These quizzes are in pdf format which can be readable through any pdf reader.
      - There is a chinook database schema in this directory too which is slightly different from the chinook database provided in the [DataBases](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/tree/main/DataBases) directory.
      - The  quizzes were solved on coursera platform and this schema is from the chinook database provided on that platform so follow this schema in case of assignments and quizzes. 
# Final Course Assigment:
- Final Course Assigment of this course is named as [Final Course Peer Review Assignment](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/SQL-for-DataScience/blob/main/Assignments/Final%20Course%20Peer%20Review%20Assignment.txt).
- This Assignment is divided into 2 parts.
  - In the first part, I was asked a series of questions that helped profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, I assessed both on the correctness of my findings, as well as the code I used to arrive at my answer. I was graded on how easy my code was to read, so I used proper formatting and comments where necessary.
  - In the second part of the assignment, I was asked to come up with my own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question that was needed to answer. I was required to prepare the dataset for the analysis I chose to do. As with the first part, I was graded, in part, on how easy my code was to read, so I used proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate my intent as required.
# Reason to upload:
When I was doing this course, It helped me a lot in my understandings and concepts by comparing assignment approach i took and work done by other people. I am very hopefull that this would be the same for someone else.
