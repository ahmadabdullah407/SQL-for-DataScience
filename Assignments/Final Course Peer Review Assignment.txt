Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =   10000
ii. Business table =   10000
iii. Category table =  10000
iv. Checkin table =    10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table =     10000
vii. hours table =     10000
viii. photo table =    10000
ix. review table =     10000
x. tip table =         10000
xi. user table =       10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =           10000		(primary key id)
ii. Hours =             1562		(foreign key business_id)
iii. Category =		2643		(foreign key business_id)
iv. Attribute =		1115		(foreign key business_id)
v. Review =		10000		(primary key id)       
vi. Checkin = 		493		(foreign key business_id)
vii. Photo =		10000		(primary key id)
viii. Tip = 		537		(foreign key user_id)
ix. User = 		10000		(primary key id)
x. Friend = 		11		(foreign key user_id)
xi. Elite_years =	2780		(foreign key user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

		SELECT COUNT(*) AS Null_values
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL
		OR name IS NULL
		OR review_count IS NULL
		OR yelping_since IS NULL
		OR useful IS NULL
		OR funny IS NULL
		OR cool IS NULL
		OR fans IS NULL
		OR average_stars IS NULL
		OR compliment_hot IS NULL
		OR compliment_more IS NULL
		OR compliment_profile IS NULL
		OR compliment_cute IS NULL
		OR compliment_list IS NULL
		OR compliment_note IS NULL
		OR compliment_plain IS NULL
		OR compliment_cool IS NULL
		OR compliment_funny IS NULL
		OR compliment_writer IS NULL
		OR compliment_photos IS NULL;
	
		
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 	1	max:	5	avg:	3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.0	max:	5.0	avg:	3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:	0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:	1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg:	24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

		SELECT city
		--,SUM(review_count) AS total_reviews    -- extra code line if want to check cities are properly sorted.
		FROM business
		-- group by city column as there are multiple businesses in a city.
		GROUP BY city
		-- Total number of reviews in a city will be sum of all review_count for businesses in that city.
		ORDER BY SUM(review_count) DESC;

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

		Yes, by annalyzing the data it seems that having more reviews correlate with more fans but more reviews is not the only factor affecting number of			reviews. The time person has been yelping is also affecting the number of fans.
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		
		SELECT id
		,review_count
		,fans
		,yelping_since
		FROM user
		ORDER BY fans DESC;


		+------------------------+--------------+------+---------------------+
		| id                     | review_count | fans | yelping_since       |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	Yes, They have different distribution of hours. In my annalysis 4-5 star businesses have shorter opening hours than 2-3 star businesses.
	Although sample size was only 4 businesses.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
	Yes and No, As sample size was only 4 review count was quite arbitrary however 1 business with 4-5 stars rating had quite high number of reviews (431) and 	other business with the same rating had lowest number of reviews (7) however both lower rating businesses had low number of reviews(8 and 60). So a bigger 	sample size is needed to derive any conclusion.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	No, Every business was in a different zip code.

SQL code used for analysis:
	
	SELECT b.name
	,h.hours
	--Grouping by day so that in order to make comparison
	,CASE 
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Monday%' THEN 1
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Tuesday%' THEN 2
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Wednesday%' THEN 3
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Thursday%' THEN 4
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Friday%' THEN 5
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Saturday%' THEN 6
    		WHEN h.hours LIKE 'Sunday%' THEN 7
    		END dayorder
	-- Grouping by star rating groups.
	,CASE 
    		WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2.0 AND 3.0 THEN '2-3stars'
    		WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 4.0 AND 5.0 THEN '4-5stars'
    		ELSE NULL
    		END starcetagory
	,b.review_count
	,b.postal_code
	FROM business B 
	INNER JOIN hours h ON h.business_id = b.id
	INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
	WHERE b.city = 'Phoenix' AND c.category ='Restaurants' AND starcetagory NOT NULL
	ORDER BY dayorder,starcetagory

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

         The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than ones that
	 are closed on average.
         
ii. Difference 2:

         More people have checked into businesses that are open compared to the ones that are closed on average.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
	
	SELECT b.is_open
	,AVG(b.review_count) AS Number_of_reviews
	,AVG(b.stars) AS Avg_Rating
	,AVG(c.count) AS Avg_checkins
	FROM business b LEFT JOIN checkin c ON b.id = c.business_id
	GROUP BY is_open;

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

	Predicting the overall star rating for a business.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        
	To predict the overall star rating we shall require data from business,hours,category and attribute tables.
	From business table we will require business id and their respective star ratings to get necessary information about how data is dispersed around different 	star ratings for future prediction. We shall also require their respective city names,longitude and latitude for location annalysis which i beilieve is a 		necessary factor prediction of star rating. We will also require review_count and is_open data columns from business tables.
	From hours table we shall require all the opening hours for different days of the week for all businesses.
	From Categories table we shall require all the categories for category columns, I used GROUP_CONCAT function to concatinate all the categories for a business 	into a single string.
	From Attributes table I first checked for most common attributes for businesses by using a sorting query so that number ofnull values could be minimized. I 	only extracted the attributes and their respective values which were present in more than 50% businesses and extracted them as individual data columns.
	This data will help predict the overall star rating for new businesses.
